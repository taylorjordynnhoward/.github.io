  <h2>
  Hi there! My name is Taylor(she/her). I am from Highlands Ranch, Colorado and currently
  am finishing up my last semester at the University of Colorado, Boulder. On the weekends, I like
  to spend time outdoors with friends, try new foods, and journal. I love to travel and have been
  to eleven different countries, my top favorites being Vietnam and Germany. I have had
  several marketing internships from agency work to consulting, and am currently looking for
  a full time job in the marketing industry. If you are interesting in hiring me or working with me,
  please check out my <a href="$">CONTACT ME</a> page and I look forward to hearing from you!
