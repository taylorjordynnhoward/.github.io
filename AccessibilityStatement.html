I found challenge 3, creating a form, to be the most accessible challenge of this project.
This is because I was able to find resources online to teach me how to make a form.
I also enjoyed this challenge because it is so applicable to the real world.
I will likely need to use what I learned for making a form later
on in my career, so I appreciated the usefulness of this assignment.
